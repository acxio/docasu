	DoCASU 1.0 leverages the understanding gained from corporate user requirements and utilizes Rich 
	Internet Application technologies such as the ExtJS AJAX framework.  DoCASU 1.0 is not intended to replace 
	the already existing Alfresco web user interface, but rather offer an alternative 
	for users who require a limited set of features and profit from simplicity and 
	ease of use.  Thousands of users are employing DoCASU at NXP, a top ten semiconductor 
	company founded by Philips, and see the benefits of the user centric solution.

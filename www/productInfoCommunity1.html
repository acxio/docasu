		Open Source is part of the DNA of Optaros. Optaros uses Open Source components themselves and on their client engagements. 
		They actively contribute to existing open source projects and when they find client needs that aren't being 
		addressed they may also publish and maintain their own projects that can be found here on code.optaros.com.

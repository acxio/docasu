<h4>White Paper, October 2008, by Olivier P&eacute;pin and Jeff Potts</h4>
<div class="whitepaper-text">
		<p>This whitepaper is a free bonus chapter developed to accompany the recently published Alfresco Developer Guide authored by Jeff Potts, content management practice lead at Optaros and Alfresco's 2007 North American Contributor of the Year. The DoCASU whitepaper illustrates how a complete web application &#150; in this case, an Alfresco Custom User Interface &#150; can be built using Alfresco Web Scripts and Rich Internet Application frameworks.</p>

<div class="whitepaper-text">
	<p>The example application, DoCASU, is a application Optaros built for a client and then made freely-available as an open source project on. Specifically, you will walk through how Optaros designed and built the DoCASU user interface, some of the major architectural and design drivers, the main parts of the DoCASU codebase and finally how to download and install the application on top of your own Alfresco repository.</p>
